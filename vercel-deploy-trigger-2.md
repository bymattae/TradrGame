- Changes to deploy: Updated label styling to be more subtle with muted gray colors
- Current commit: 44b99fe (refactor: replace high-contrast pill labels with subtle inline labels)

1. Check Vercel project settings
2. Verify GitHub webhook configuration
3. Consider manually triggering deployment from Vercel dashboard
